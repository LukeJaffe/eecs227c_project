	abstract = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition [10, 14, 15, 17], implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called {FaceNet}, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure offace similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with {FaceNet} embeddings asfeature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-artface recognition performance using only 128-bytes perface. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild ({LFW}) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On {YouTube} Faces {DB} it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result [15] by 30\% on both datasets.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07737v4},
	abstract = {In the past few years, the field of computer vision has gone through a
revolution fueled mainly by the advent of large datasets and the adoption of
deep convolutional neural networks for end-to-end learning. The person
re-identification subfield is no exception to this. Unfortunately, a prevailing
belief in the community seems to be that the triplet loss is inferior to using
surrogate losses (classification, verification) followed by a separate metric
learning step. We show that, for models trained from scratch as well as
pretrained ones, using a variant of the triplet loss to perform end-to-end deep
metric learning outperforms most other published methods by a large margin.},
